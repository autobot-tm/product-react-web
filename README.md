# FashionHub

## Project Brief

FashionHub is a modern e-commerce platform built using **Next.js 15** and **React 19**, leveraging the latest technologies to provide a robust and efficient shopping experience.

The project is developed using **TypeScript**, which adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability. Additionally, **SCSS** and **Tailwind CSS** are used for styling, allowing for a combination of traditional CSS pre-processing and utility-first CSS for rapid UI development.

### Key Technologies Used:

- **Next.js 15**
- **React 19**
- **SWR**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **Axios**
- **MUI**

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autobot-tm/product-react-web.git
cd <repository-directory>
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
